# Components
It has 2 components: `llbs` and `bs`.

`llbs` stands for "**l**ow-**l**evel **b**rain**s**uck", it's an
assembly-like language. `bs` stands for "**b**rain**s**uck", it's a
high-level language just like `c` or whatever.

`bs` compiles source codes to llbs, and llbs then produces brainfuck codes.
